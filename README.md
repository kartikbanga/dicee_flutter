# Dicee Flutter App

The Dicee Flutter App is a simple mobile application that simulates the rolling of two dice. When the user taps on a dice, the app generates random numbers for each dice, providing a visual representation of the rolled dice faces. This app is built using the Flutter framework, making it easy to run on both Android and iOS devices.

## Features

- Simulate rolling of two dice with random results.
- Interactive user interface that responds to dice taps.
- Realistic dice images to represent the rolled numbers.
